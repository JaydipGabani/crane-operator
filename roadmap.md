## MTRHO (Crane Operator) 

Migration Toolkit for Red Hat OpenShift is the downstream version of Crane.   MTRHO includes a UI-Pluging only available for OpenShift in our downstream version of Crane.   While Crane is focused on the CLI tooling, MTRHO provide a UI driven experience of Crane for OpenShift developers and application owners.

### Future Roadmap

We expect an MTRHO 1.1 release by the end of 2022.    At this time, we expect this release to be about onboarding GitOps while migrating + potential other use-cases based on 1.0 feedback.   We expect MTRHO 1.1 to be scoped and have a fully detailed roadmap mid-2022, close to the release of MTRHO 1.0.
